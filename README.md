PaperclipJS is a tiny template engine for the DOM. It compiles HTML straight to JavaScript, and only updates the parts it needs to. This means you get Ã¼ber fast apps with a low CPU & memory footprint.

Paperclip was designed for interoperability, and customization. Incorporate it into your existing application, or use it with any rendering engine (DOM, Canvas, WebGL, server-side).

#### Basic example

index.js:

```javascript
var pc      = require("paperclip");
var fs      = require("fs");

// readFileSync works in the browser assuming you're using brfs with browserify
var template = pc.template(fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "/template.pc", "utf8"), {

    // compiler not included by default. Register it to this template
    compile: require("paperclip/compile/default")
});

// create a view from the template
var view = template.view({
    items: [1, 2, 3],
    addItem: function() {
        this.set("items", this.items.concat(this.items.length + 1));
    }
});

document.body.appendChild(view.render());
```

template.pc:

```html
<button onclick={{ addItem.bind(this) }}>add item</button>
<ul>
    <li repeat.each={{items}} repeat.as="item">
        {{item}}
    </li>
</ul>
```

####  Features

- Runs on any platform (web, mobile, NodeJS)
- Super fast. Uses native browser APIs such as `cloneNode()` for super fast rendering.
- Tiny (7kb gzipped without parser)
- Supports any rendering engine (WebGL, Canvas, SVG, custom).
- Supports inline JavaScript
- Works with old browsers (IE 8+)
- No browser dependencies
- Explicit data binding operators

#### Installation

[NPM](http://nodejs.org):

`npm install paperclip --save`

[Bower](http://bower.io/):

`bower install paperclip`


#### Command line usage

Paperclip templates can also be compiled straight to javascript. This is a great utility if you want to pre-compile your templates for the browser, or want to use Paperclip in a module system such as [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/), or [browserify](http://browserify.org/). In your project directory, simply run:

```
npm install paperclip
```

then run:

```
cat ./template.pc | ./node_modules/.bin/paperclip > ./template.pc.js
```

to compile templates into JavaScript.
